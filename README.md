# WooooWakeup

is a morning wake up call app built on express. Uses forecast.io API to gather weather data and adjust wake up call time based on current weather conditions. Twilio API is used to send a text message to alert the enduser to wake up. 

A live example is hosted at [woooowakeup.herokuapp.com](https://woooowakeup.herokuapp.com/)
***Warning the Twilio API is not active, so wake ups will not occur***
